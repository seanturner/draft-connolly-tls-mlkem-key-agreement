1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   FIPS 203 standard (ML-KEM) is a new FIPS / CNSA 2.0 standard for
   post-quantum key agreement via lattice-based key establishment
   mechanism (KEM).  Having a fully post-quantum (not hybrid) FIPS-
   compliant key agreement option for TLS 1.3 is necessary for eventual
   movement beyond hybrids and for users that need to be fully post-
   quantum sooner than later.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Construction

   We align with [hybrid] except that instead of joining ECDH options
   with a KEM, we just have the KEM as a NamedGroup.

4.  Security Considerations

   TLS 1.3's key schedule commits to the the ML-KEM encapsulation key
   and the encapsulated shared secret ciphertext, providing resilience
   against re-encapsulation attacks against KEMs used for key agreement.

   ML-KEM is MAL-BIND-K-PK-secure but only LEAK-BIND-K-CT and LEAK-BIND-
   K,PK-CT-secure, but because of the inclusion of the ML-KEM ciphertext
   in the TLS 1.3 key schedule there is no concern of malicious
   tampering (MAL) adversaries, not just honestly-generated but leaked
   key pairs (LEAK adversaries).  The same is true of other KEMs with
   weaker binding properties, even if they were to have more constraints
   for secure use in contexts outside of TLS 1.3 handshake key
   agreement.These computational binding properties for KEMs were
   formalized in [CDM23].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests/registers two new entries to the TLS Named
   Group (or Supported Group) registry, according to the procedures in
   Section 6 of [tlsiana].
